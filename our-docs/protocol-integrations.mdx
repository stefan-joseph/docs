## Currently supported protocols

We currently support Uniswap, Aave, and Aerodrome on Ethereum, Base and Arbitrum.

We are continuously adding support for **new protocols** and welcome projects that want to be part of the **Compass API ecosystem**. If you're interested in integrating, **reach out to us**, and we'll explore how we can work together.

## Integrate your own protocol

If you'd like to **accelerate the process and integrate yourself**, we've created an **API Integration Demo** to guide you through it.

<Tip>
  **Get started here:** [**GitHub â€“ API Integration
  Demo**](https://github.com/CompassLabs/api_integration_demo)
</Tip>

This demo is **still new**, and weâ€™re currently testing it with a few protocols. Your **feedback is highly valuable**â€”let us know if you have any questions or suggestions!

**Integration Requirements**

Our API runs on **FastAPI**, so the key things to get right are the expected format of the input and output Pydantic model. If you've got those down, then writing the logic which fetches information off-chain and forms unsigned transactions will make it easy for us to fit your protocol into our code base.
